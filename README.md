## Delayed-Flights

#### Overview
- This workbook will explore the "[`Flights Dataset`](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html)" and predicts delayed flights at airports located in the United States bases on previous flight records. The dataset consists of flight information such as arrival and departure times. Additionally, the .dat file for plotting the geographical location of airports in the U.S. can be found [`here`](https://github.com/jpatokal/openflights/blob/master/data/airports.dat). Jupyter Notebook and Spark is utilized to explore, analyze and visualize the results. This dataset examines flights in 2008 which is roughly 7 million flights! Apache Spark (locally) will be utilized to analyze this dataset.
